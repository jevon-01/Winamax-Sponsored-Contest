# Recursion-and-backtracking-Codingame

This project solves a CodinGame puzzle where the goal is to route multiple golf balls to different holes on a grid-based course.

Each ball has a limited number of strokes, paths must not cross, and all movement constraints (obstacles, water hazards, grid boundaries) must be respected. The program outputs a grid of directional arrows representing the unique valid solution.
